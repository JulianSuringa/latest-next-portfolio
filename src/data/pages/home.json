     "I have experience in both front-end and back-end development. On the front end, I work with HTML, CSS (including SCSS, CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, and Tailwind), and JavaScript with tools like React, Redux, Zustand, and TypeScript. On the back end, I use Node.js and databases such as MSSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. I also have basic knowledge of Docker and React Native, and experience writing unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library. Additionally, Iâ€™ve worked on Android development, mainly fixing bugs using Kotlin and Java."
